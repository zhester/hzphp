hzphp\SQLite
============

This module provides several utility extensions to the stock SQLite3
implementation.  It is not intended to duplicate or replace functionality.

The driving goal is to build a general-purpose database browsing/management
interface.  The interfaces and idioms established here should eventually be
formalized so management front-ends can snap into any DBMS abstraction layer.
